**Observations of Mahanttan AirBnBs(HC3)**  
For our group, the qualities that make a neighborhood a desirable place to live in are safety or low crime, affordability, access to transportation, convenient location, good public schools, more jobs, and access to other amenities (restaurants, parks, gyms, grocery stores, etc.). The three most important qualities for us are safety, affordability, and convenient location. We consider these three qualities to be the most essential because when choosing a neighborhood to live in, you want to feel safe in your home and walking around your neighborhood; you want to be able to comfortably afford your rent every month; and you want your apartment to be in a convenient location in terms of having easy access to transportation and a short commute time to work or other places around the city.

	Looking specifically at Chinatown, it seems that there is an inverse relationship between reviews per month and price. The lower the price, the higher the reviews per month. The higher the price the lower reviews per month. It is important to note that there are many listings that have 0 reviews per month, which may skew the data. Reflecting this back to our observations in HC2/HC3, this shows that price is a very important factor when picking an airbnb.

	Analyzing the relationship between reviews per month and availability, there seems to be no correlation between the two. The reviews per month seem to be spread evenly throughout the graph, with the only concentration being at 0 availability. This is interesting because I would expect an airbnb with larger availability to have more reviews per month. However, this is not the case. In fact, the listing with the highest amount of reviews per month of (9.39) has an availability of 50 and the listing with the second highest amount of reviews per month of (8.95) has an availability of 240.
